        <h3 class="question">How does a solar eclipse occur?</h3>
        <p class="description">
          A solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between the Earth and the
          Sun, aligning perfectly during a new moon phase. The Moon casts two
          shadows: the penumbra and the umbra. When an observer is within the
          umbra's path, they witness a total solar eclipse, with the Moon
          completely covering the Sun, causing a temporary darkness. In the
          penumbral region, a partial solar eclipse occurs, where the Moon
          partially obscures the Sun, creating a crescent shape. An annular
          eclipse occurs when the Moon is at its farthest point from Earth,
          appearing smaller and leaving a ring-like appearance. Always use
          proper eye protection when viewing a solar eclipse.
        </p>

        <h3 class="question">Why do only some people see it?</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Only some people see a solar eclipse because it's a localized event. A
          total solar eclipse is visible along a narrow "path of totality,"
          which varies with each eclipse. This path passes over specific regions
          while leaving others outside it. The eclipse's timing is crucial,
          occurring when the Earth, Moon, and Sun align during daylight hours.
          Consequently, if it's nighttime in your location or you're not in the
          path of totality, you won't see a total eclipse. Partial eclipses are
          more common but still require the Moon to partially cover the Sun,
          making them visible from specific areas during the event.
        </p>

        <h3 class="question">How often do these types of eclipses occur?</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Total solar eclipses occur about every 18 months somewhere on Earth
          but are rare for any single location, happening roughly once every few
          centuries. Partial eclipses are more frequent, occurring several times
          a year worldwide. The exact frequency depends on your geographical
          location. Annular eclipses, with a ring-like appearance, are less
          common, happening approximately every 1-2 years somewhere on Earth.
          Solar eclipses are cyclical due to the Moon's orbit, but their
          occurrence varies widely based on your location, making them a
          relatively infrequent celestial event in any given place. Observers
          often travel to specific locations to witness total eclipses.

        </p>

        <h3 class="question">How does a lunar eclipse occur?</h3>
        <p class="description">
          A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth passes between the Sun and the
          Moon, casting its shadow on the Moon's surface. This happens during a
          full moon when the three celestial bodies align. Earth's shadow has
          two parts: the penumbra (partial shadow) and the umbra (full shadow).
          The Moon can partially or completely enter these shadows, resulting in
          various types of lunar eclipses.
        </p>

        <h3 class="question">Why do only some people see it?</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Not everyone can see lunar eclipses because they are visible from the
          nighttime side of Earth during a full moon. The Earth's shadow only
          covers the Moon when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are precisely aligned.
          Thus, whether you can see a lunar eclipse depends on your location and
          the timing of the event.
        </p>

        <h3 class="question">How often do these types of eclipses occur?</h3>
        <p class="description">
          Lunar eclipses happen roughly twice a year on average. However,
          they're not visible from every location during each event. The
          frequency of seeing lunar eclipses depends on your geographical
          location and the alignment of the Earth, Moon, and Sun during full
          moons.

        <h2 class="question">What causes the Sun, Moon, and Earth to align?</h2>
        <img
          src="https://blogs.nasa.gov/Watch_the_Skies/wp-content/uploads/sites/193/2017/07/moonphases801.jpg"
          alt="Earth and the moons phases orbital diagram"
        />
        <p class="description">
          The alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth occurs due to the relative
          positions and motions of these celestial bodies. It happens during
          specific lunar phases. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon is
          positioned between the Earth and Sun during a new moon. A lunar
          eclipse happens when the Earth comes between the Sun and Moon during a
          full moon. These alignments result from the orbital paths of the Moon
          and Earth, creating opportunities for eclipses to occur.
        </p>

        <h2 class="question">
          What is an eclipse season and why do they occur approximately every
          six months (or twice a year)?
        </h2>
        <img src="./images/season.webp" alt="" class="eclipse_media" />
        <p class="description">
          An eclipse season is a period when solar and lunar eclipses become
          more likely, occurring approximately every six months. This happens
          because the Moon's orbit is tilted relative to Earth's orbit around
          the Sun. During eclipse seasons, the Moon crosses Earth's orbital
          plane (the ecliptic), allowing alignments where the Sun, Earth, and
          Moon can create eclipses. These seasons occur in pairs, about 5.5
          months apart, due to the repeating geometry of the Moon's orbit.
        </p>

        <h2 class="question">
          How do scientists know when and where eclipses will occur?
        </h2>
        <img src="./images/math.webp" alt="math_pic" class="eclipse_media" />
        <p class="description">
          Scientists predict eclipses using precise mathematical models. They
          track the Moon's orbit, Earth's orbit, and the Sun's position. Special
          software calculates when the alignment occurs, determining eclipse
          timing and path. Astronomical data and historical records verify
          predictions, ensuring accuracy in forecasting eclipses worldwide.
